Five-time Masters champion Woods is playing in Group 14, alongside South African Louis Oosthuizen and Chilean Joaquin Niemann, though the first round of the 2022 Masters at Augusta National Golf Club tournament was delayed due to inclement weather in Augusta, Georgia.
"Due to thunderstorms in the early morning hours Thursday, gate opening times will be delayed by 30 minutes," the Masters said in a statement on Thursday.
"The Honorary Starters will take place at 8:15 a.m., followed by the first tee time at 8:30 a.m."
Wearing a pink shirt, Woods was given a resounding round of applause from the crowd as his name was announced. After hitting his opening drive, Woods received more cheers from fans.
His drive wasn't perfect, though the 46-year-old ended up making par on the first hole to the delight of the watching patrons.
Woods' first birdie came on the sixth hole after his excellent tee shot left him a short putt to shoot up to under par for the first time.
However, after bogeying the eighth hole, Woods finished the front-nine level par.
