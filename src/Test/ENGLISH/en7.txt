The legal analyst said she's reminded in these instances of something Chief Justice John Roberts has said.

"A fresh justice brings an array of fresh thoughts about how the operations behind the scenes, about cases, and that just changes everyone to maybe alter his or her lens a little bit," the analyst said.

Biskupic also referenced comments made by former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor when Thurgood Marshall was appointed as the first Black justice in 1967.

"That his special perspective and his ability to tell stories around the private conference table really got them thinking in different ways. He might not have changed votes, but he at least changed the discussion. So, I think all of those things... will essentially affect and bring us a new Supreme Court," she added.
