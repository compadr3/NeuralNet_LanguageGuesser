Since his car accident, Woods has appeared in public on a golf course just once -- at the PNC Championship in December with his son Charlie. Then Woods used a golf cart to help him get around the course.
"Walking is the hard part. This is not an easy walk to begin with," Woods said to the PGA Tour, referring to Augusta's hilly course.
"With the conditions my leg is in, it gets a little bit more difficult. Seventy-two holes is a long road. It's going to be a tough challenge and a challenge I'm up for."
