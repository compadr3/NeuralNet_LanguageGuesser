The fresh sanctions package, taken in lockstep with European Union allies and the Group of 7 nations, will also ban new investment in Russia and state-owned enterprises, sources said.

News of the additional measures follows rounds of coordinated sanctions that have vaulted Russia past Iran and North Korea as the worldâ€™s most-sanctioned country. The measures have damaged the Russian economy as Moscow pushes ahead with the brutal invasion of its neighbor.

The new sanctions come amid global outrage over mounting evidence of Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Over the weekend, Ukrainian officials claimed that hundreds of civilians were tortured and killed in Bucha by Russian troops.
