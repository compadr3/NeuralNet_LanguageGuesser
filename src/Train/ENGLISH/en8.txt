Hurts has already made history after passing Cam Newton for the most rushing touchdowns in a single season during the Eagles’ NFC Championship victory against the San Francisco 49ers, while Mahomes overcame an ankle injury to throw for 326 yards and two touchdowns against the Cincinnati Bengals.

There is hope that their actions on the field could inspire generations to come.

“I know those guys are going to be hyped up and ready to play,” Chicago Bears quarterback Justin Fields told CNN.

“But it’s definitely a big moment for a lot of Black, young QBs coming up and having them inspire them and maybe they’re saying to themselves: ‘That could be me one day.’”

Growing up, Fields was inspired by another Black quarterback, Newton, to such an extent that he has been wearing the former Carolina Panthers star’s iconic No. 1 jersey since eighth grade.
